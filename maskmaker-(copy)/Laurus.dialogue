	Laurus: Ants mostly, that's what are the most common. I also like to watch the butterflies and moths.

	Maskmaker: Will you miss them?

	Laurus: Ascending is replacing pain with joy.
	Laurus: I may not know what will come after I rise, but I do know that Ocara loves us and would not let us suffer in heaven. [if mood == "open"]I do fear how they will get on without me, but I managed when my parents ascended.[/if]

			Maskmaker: It was probably 30 years ago by now, but the maskmaker that was talking to me saw something in me that I didn't see myself.

			Maskmaker: I did not show my devotion in the same way as the other clergy, but my love of the oceanic made my 10 years in heaven wonderful.

~ firstStandardQuestion
Maskmaker: Laurus, how do you wish to be remembered?
Laurus: ...[wait=3] I don't know if I want to.
Maskmaker: Be remembered?
Laurus: Yes.
Maskmaker: Why is that?
Laurus: My actions speak for themselves. To worry about the legacy is to put my will above Ocara's.
Maskmaker: Well said.

~ secondStandardQuestion
Maskmaker: Laurus, when I ask the caretaker who raised you, Crellon, who you are what do you think she will say?
Laurus: That I asked too many questions, probably.
Maskmaker: Were you a curious child?
Laurus: I suppose so. I asked her about everything and anything, and she did what she could to answer them.
Laurus: Without leading me down dark paths, of course.
Maskmaker: Curiousity is a double-edged sword.
Laurus: One I hope I have tempered well.

~ thirdStandardQuestion
Maskmaker: Laurus, what do you think Ocara wills for you?
Laurus: To serve.
Maskmaker: Serve how?
Laurus: Where the need is greatest.
Maskmaker: Which is where?
Laurus: Only Ocara knows.
Maskmaker: I see. Thank you.

~ closingQuestion
Maskmaker: Eiche, will the tide rise or fall?
Laurus: It rises even now.
Maskmaker: ...[wait=3] Wise words.
Maskmaker: Thank you Laurus for your time. I will now build your new face.
Laurus: Yes honorable maskmaker. The tide rises.
Maskmaker: The tide rises.

~ miner
Maskmaker: I have chosen the miner mask for you. Your job will be hard work, but it will be the work that glorifies Ocara. [if interests.has("Doctor")]And this way you may keep your bug collection.[/if]
Some Years Later: Laurus has died young due to a mining accident. That is not uncommon for a miner, but it saddens you all the same. 
Some Years Later: You still remember the brief conversation you shared. It is not often you see such a devoted soul.
=> END!
~ doctor
Maskmaker: I have chosen the doctor mask for you. You will give aid to the children here and will be able to travel to heaven and back in order to disposed of the bodies of the tainted.
Some Years Later: Laurus has bloomed under the role of doctor. Last year when you fractured your finger Laurus was able to fix you up in no time. They seem to be happy.
=> END!
~ entertainer
Maskmaker: I have chosen the entertainer mask for you. Your skills will help others devote more to their work[if interests.has("Entertainer")], especially your abilities of dance[/if].
Some Years Later: Laurus has not done well as an entertainer. They were excited at first, but aprehensive about their abilities.[if interests.has("Entertainer")] Laurus' stage fright ended up debilitating their career. An entertainer that cannot perform is of no use.[/if]
=> END!
~ reclaimer
Maskmaker: I have chosen the entertainer mask for you. You will have the privilege of building up heaven physically.
Some Years Later: Laurus was not cut out for reclaimer. A building that they had revived suddenly colapsed on a group of gardeners, killing everyone.
Some Years Later: The guilt of it all was too much for Laurus and they returned back to the ocean far before their time.
=> END!
~ gardener
Maskmaker: I have chosen the gardener mask for you. Your help in bringing life back to heaven is revered and you will recieve many blessings.
Some Years Later: Laurus is a capable gardener, though a bit apathetic. Laurus sent a letter to you a while back. They seemed...[wait=.5] melancholy.
=> END!
~ priest
Maskmaker: I have chosen the priest mask for you. Rejoice, for this role is sacred and blessed. [if interests.has("Entertainer")]Your skills of teaching will be well used.[/if]
Some Years Later: Laurus comes to visit often. They are doing well, but the bright spirit they once had has somewhat dimmed. [if interests.has("Entertainer")]Teaching is a fulfilling career, but Laurus has confided that they sneak away at night sometimes to dance in the moonlight.[/if]
